Breakdown this page into react-style components. First, find the nearest red number in parentheses so you can mark down its location on the page. This will be the positionMarker. Then give it a name like it is a react component. Then give it a short description. Then extract whatever text it has into textContent. Return all the components using a nested JSON tree structure. Each object has the following 5 attributes: positionMarker, name, description, textContent, children. The root object is named \"Page\".

Give me a high-level component-based representation of this image. Each component has one or more IDs associated with it. Put all these IDs in a list. They are above each component in red parentheses. Name each component as if it is a react component. Write a short description for each component. Put the textContent of the component into textContent. The root component is named \"Page\". Return your answer as a JSON tree of nested objects each with 5 properties: idList, name, description, textContent, children. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ONE COMPONENT FOR EACH CLICKABLE/INTERACTABLE ELEMENT! THIS IS OF DIRE IMPORTANCE. Only reply with the JSON, nothing else. No other words.
